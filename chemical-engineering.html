        <p class="intro-paragraph">
            Chemical engineering is an engineering field which deals with the study of the operation and design of chemical plants as well as methods of improving production. Chemical engineers develop economical commercial processes to convert raw materials into useful products. Chemical engineering uses principles of chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, and economics to efficiently use, produce, design, transport and transform energy and materials.

                <h2 class="section-title">Overview and Scope</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The work of chemical engineers can range from the utilization of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in the laboratory to large-scale industrial processes that convert chemicals, raw materials, living cells, microorganisms, and energy into useful forms and products. Chemical engineers are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation, including safety and hazard assessments, process design and analysis, modeling, control engineering, chemical reaction engineering, nuclear engineering, biological engineering, construction specification, and operating instructions.</p>
                    <p>Chemical engineers typically hold a degree in Chemical Engineering or Process Engineering. Practicing engineers may have professional certification and be accredited members of a professional body. Such bodies include the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) or the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) and respective states in the U.S., which ultimately confer licensure and title of Professional Engineer.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>A 1996 article cites James F. Donnelly for mentioning an 1839 reference to chemical engineering in relation to the production of sulfuric acid. In the same paper, George E. Davis, an English consultant, was credited with having coined the term. Davis also tried to found a Society of Chemical Engineering, but instead, it was named the Society of Chemical Industry in 1881, with Davis as its first secretary.</p>
                    <p>The History of Science in United States: An Encyclopedia puts the use of the term around 1890. "Chemical engineering," describing the use of mechanical equipment in the chemical industry, became common vocabulary in England after 1850. By 1910, the profession of "chemical engineer" was already in common use in Britain and the United States.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">New Concepts and Innovations</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>In the 1940s, it became clear that unit operations alone were insufficient in developing chemical reactors. While the predominance of unit operations in chemical engineering courses in Britain and the United States continued until the 1960s, transport phenomena started to receive greater focus. Along with other novel concepts, such as process systems engineering (PSE), a "second paradigm" was defined.</p>
                    <p>Transport phenomena gave an analytical approach to chemical engineering while PSE focused on its synthetic elements, such as those of a control system and process design. Developments in chemical engineering before and after World War II were mainly incited by the petrochemical industry; however, advances in other fields were made as well.</p>
                    <p>Advancements in biochemical engineering in the 1940s found application in the pharmaceutical industry, and allowed for the mass production of various antibiotics, including penicillin and streptomycin. Meanwhile, progress in polymer science in the 1950s paved the way for the "age of plastics."</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Safety and Hazard Development</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Concerns regarding large-scale chemical manufacturing facilities' safety and environmental impact were raised during this period. Silent Spring, published in 1962, alerted readers to the harmful effects of DDT, a potent insecticide. The 1974 Flixborough disaster in the United Kingdom resulted in 28 deaths, as well as damage to a chemical plant and three nearby villages. The 1984 Bhopal disaster in India resulted in at least 4,000 deaths. These incidents, along with other incidents, affected the reputation of the trade as industrial safety and environmental protection were given more focus.</p>
                    <p>In response, the IChemE required safety to be part of every degree course that it accredited after 1982. By the 1970s, legislation and monitoring agencies were instituted in various countries, such as France, Germany, and the United States. In time, the systematic application of safety principles to chemical and other process plants began to be considered a specific discipline, known as process safety.</p>

                    <p>Advancements in computer science found applications for designing and managing plants, simplifying calculations and drawings that previously had to be done manually. Programs such as Aspen HYSYS were developed to complete multiple chemical engineering calculations.</p>
                    <p>The completion of the Human Genome Project is seen as a major development, not only advancing chemical engineering but genetic engineering and genomics as well. Chemical engineering principles were used to produce DNA sequences in large quantities. These developments have opened new possibilities in biotechnology and biopharmaceutical production.</p>
