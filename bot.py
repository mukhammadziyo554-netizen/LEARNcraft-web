DAILY_TIPS = [
    "💡 *Tip of the Day: Stress vs Strain*\nStress is the FORCE applied, Strain is the DEFORMATION caused. Remember: Stress = cause, Strain = effect!",
    "🔍 *Quick Fact: Hooke's Law*\nStress is directly proportional to strain: σ = E × ε (where E is Young's modulus)",
    "⚙️ *Mechanical Insight*\nEfficiency = (Useful Output / Total Input) × 100%. Always less than 100% due to friction and heat loss!",
    "⚡ *Electrical Truth*\nOhm's Law: V = I × R. If voltage increases and resistance stays same, current increases proportionally.",
    "🌊 *Civil Engineering*\nBeam deflection depends on: Load, span length, material rigidity, and support type. More flexible materials = more deflection!",
    "🔬 *Chemistry Note*\nIdeal Gas Law: PV = nRT. At constant volume, if temperature increases, pressure increases (used in pressure vessels!).",
    "🏗️ *Construction Wisdom*\nConcrete strength depends on water-cement ratio. Too much water = weak concrete. The correct ratio is critical!",
    "⚙️ *Power Calculation*\nP = F × v (Power = Force × Velocity). Or P = W/t. Higher velocity with same force = higher power output!",
    "🌡️ *Heat Transfer*\nQ = m × c × ΔT. To heat 1kg of water by 1°C needs 4186 Joules (specific heat capacity of water)",
    "🔌 *Electrical Power*\nP = V × I = I²R. More current or higher voltage = more power. Power dissipation creates heat (transformer losses!)",
