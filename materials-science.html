        <p class="intro-paragraph">
            Materials science is an interdisciplinary field of researching and discovering materials. Materials engineering is an engineering field of finding uses for materials in other fields and industries. Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering and was long considered a sub-field of these related disciplines. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science became widely recognized as a distinct field, and major technical universities created dedicated schools for its study.

                <h2 class="section-title">Materials Paradigm</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Materials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material (processing) influences its structure, and thus the material's properties and performance. The understanding of processing–structure–properties relationships is called the materials paradigm. This paradigm is used to advance understanding in research areas including nanotechnology, biomaterials, and metallurgy.</p>
                    <p>Materials science is also an important part of forensic engineering and failure analysis, investigating materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not function as intended, causing injury or damage. Such investigations help determine causes of incidents, including aviation accidents.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The material of choice of a given era is often a defining point. Phases such as Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Steel Age are historic examples. Originally deriving from the manufacture of ceramics and its derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science.</p>
                    <p>Modern materials science evolved directly from metallurgy, which itself evolved from the use of fire. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs demonstrated that thermodynamic properties related to atomic structure in various phases are related to physical properties of materials.</p>
                    <p>Important elements of modern materials science were products of the Space Race; the understanding and engineering of metallic alloys, and silica and carbon materials used in building space vehicles. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, revolutionary technologies such as rubbers, plastics, semiconductors, and biomaterials.</p>
                    <p>Before the 1960s, many materials science departments were metallurgy or ceramics engineering departments, reflecting 19th and early 20th-century emphasis on metals and ceramics. Growth in the United States was catalyzed by ARPA, which funded university-hosted laboratories in the early 1960s to expand basic research and training in materials science.</p>
                    <p>Compared with mechanical engineering, the nascent field focused on the macro-level and on designing materials based on knowledge of microscopic behavior. This led to deliberate materials design based on specific desired properties. The field now includes ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, magnetic materials, biomaterials, and nanomaterials, often classified into three groups: ceramics, metals, and polymers.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>A material is defined as a substance intended to be used for certain applications. Materials range from traditional solids to new and advanced materials such as nanomaterials, biomaterials, and energy materials. The basis of materials science is the interplay between structure, processing, and properties, which together determine performance in specific applications.</p>
                    <p>Materials scientists use thermodynamics and kinetics to understand and improve materials. Thermodynamics explains macroscopic variables and phase behavior; kinetics describes how materials change with time, including diffusion and microstructure evolution under heat.</p>
