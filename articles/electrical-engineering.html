        <p class="intro-paragraph">
            Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems that use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after the commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use.

                <h2 class="section-title">Scope and Fields</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Electrical engineering is divided into a wide range of different fields, including computer engineering, systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, control engineering, photovoltaic cells, electronics, and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations.</p>
                    <p>Electrical engineers typically hold a degree in electrical engineering, electronic or electrical and electronic engineering. They work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable, ranging from circuit theory to project management skills.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Electricity has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early 17th century. William Gilbert was a prominent early electrical scientist and is credited with establishing the term "electricity." In the 19th century, research intensified with notable developments including the work of Hans Christian Ørsted, who discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field, and Michael Faraday, the discoverer of electromagnetic induction in 1831.</p>
                    <p>Electrical telegraphy may be considered the first example of electrical engineering. The profession emerged in the later 19th century as practitioners created a global electric telegraph network. The first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and US. By the end of the 19th century, the world had been forever changed by rapid communication made possible through land-lines, submarine cables, and wireless telegraphy.</p>
                    <p>The 20th century saw revolutionary developments including the transistor invented at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1947, the integrated circuit in 1959, and the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) in 1959, which became the basic building block of modern electronics and enabled the microprocessor revolution.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Education and Professional Practice</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Electrical engineers typically possess an academic degree with a major in electrical engineering or electronics engineering. The length of study is usually four or five years, resulting in a Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of Science degree. The program includes units covering physics, mathematics, computer science, project management, and various topics in electrical engineering.</p>
                    <p>After completing a certified degree program, engineers must satisfy a range of requirements including work experience before professional certification. Once certified, engineers are designated titles such as Professional Engineer, Chartered Engineer, or European Engineer depending on the country. Professional bodies include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).</p>
