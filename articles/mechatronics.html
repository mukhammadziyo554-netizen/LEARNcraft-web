        <p class="intro-paragraph">
            Mechatronics engineering is the synergistic integration of mechanical, electrical, and computer systems employing mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, electronic engineering and computer science. It includes a combination of robotics, computer science, telecommunications, systems, control, automation and product engineering. The field produces design solutions that unify these subfields into simpler, more economical, and reliable systems.

                <h2 class="section-title">Definition and Scope</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>As technology advances, various subfields of engineering adapt and multiply. The intention of mechatronics is to produce a design solution that unifies these fields. Originally, mechatronics was intended to be a combination of mechanics, electrical and electronics, hence the portmanteau of "mechanics" and "electronics." As the complexity of technical systems evolved, the definition broadened to include more technical areas.</p>
                    <p>Many people treat mechatronics as a modern buzzword synonymous with automation, robotics and electromechanical engineering. French standard NF E 01-010 defines it as an approach aiming at the synergistic integration of mechanics, electronics, control theory, and computer science within product design and manufacturing, in order to improve or optimize functionality.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>No later than 1951, the word mechatronics was used in an advertisement by Servomechanisms, Inc. The term originated in Japanese-English and was created by Tetsuro Mori of Yaskawa Electric Corporation. The company registered the word as a trademark in Japan in 1971 and later released the right to use it publicly, leading to global adoption.</p>
                    <p>With the advent of information technology in the 1980s, microprocessors were introduced into mechanical systems, improving performance significantly. By the 1990s, advances in computational intelligence were applied to mechatronics in ways that revolutionized the field.</p>
