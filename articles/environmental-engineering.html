        <p class="intro-paragraph">
            Environmental engineering is a professional engineering discipline related to environmental science. It encompasses broad scientific topics like chemistry, biology, ecology, geology, hydraulics, hydrology, microbiology, and mathematics to create solutions that will protect and improve the health of living organisms and improve the quality of the environment. Environmental engineering is a subdiscipline of civil engineering and chemical engineering, with focus on sanitary engineering.

                <h2 class="section-title">Overview and Scope</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Environmental engineering applies scientific and engineering principles to improve and maintain the environment to protect human health, protect nature's beneficial ecosystems, and improve environmental-related enhancement of the quality of human life. Environmental engineers devise solutions for wastewater management, water and air pollution control, recycling, waste disposal, and public health.</p>
                    <p>They design municipal water supply and industrial wastewater treatment systems, and design plans to prevent waterborne diseases and improve sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas. Environmental engineers evaluate hazardous-waste management systems to assess the severity of such hazards, advise on treatment and containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps.</p>
                    <p>Environmental engineers implement environmental engineering law and assess the environmental impact of proposed construction projects. They study the effect of technological advances on the environment, addressing local and worldwide environmental issues such as acid rain, global warming, ozone depletion, water pollution and air pollution from automobile exhausts and industrial sources. Most jurisdictions impose licensing and registration requirements for qualified environmental engineers.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Etymology</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The word environmental has its root in the late 19th-century French word "environ" (verb), meaning to encircle or to encompass. The word environment was used by Carlyle in 1827 to refer to the aggregate of conditions in which a person or thing lives. The meaning shifted again in 1956 when it was used in the ecological sense, where ecology is the branch of science dealing with the relationship of living things to their environment.</p>
                    <p>The second part of the phrase "environmental engineer" originates from Latin roots and was used in the 14th century French as "engignour," meaning a constructor of military engines such as trebuchets, harquebuses, longbows, cannons, catapults, ballistas, stirrups, and armor as well as other deadly or bellicose contraptions. The word engineer was not used to reference public works until the 16th century and likely entered popular vernacular during John Smeaton's time as meaning a contriver of public works.</p>

                        <p class="subsection-text">Environmental engineering is a name for work that has been done since early civilizations, as people learned to modify and control environmental conditions to meet needs. As people recognized that their health was related to the quality of their environment, they built systems to improve it. The ancient Indus Valley Civilization (3300 B.C.E. to 1300 B.C.E.) had advanced control over their water resources. Public work structures found at various sites include wells, public baths, water storage tanks, a drinking water system, and a city-wide sewage collection system. They also had an early canal irrigation system enabling large-scale agriculture.</p>
                        <p class="subsection-text">From 4000 to 2000 B.C.E., many civilizations had drainage systems and sanitation facilities, including the Mesopotamian Empire, Mohenjo-Daro, Egypt, Crete, and the Orkney Islands in Scotland. The Greeks also had aqueducts and sewer systems that used rain and wastewater to irrigate and fertilize fields.</p>

                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h3 class="subsection-title">Roman Engineering</h3>
                        <p class="subsection-text">The first aqueduct in Rome was constructed in 312 B.C.E., and the Romans continued to construct aqueducts for irrigation and safe urban water supply during droughts. They also built an underground sewer system as early as the 7th century B.C.E. that fed into the Tiber River, draining marshes to create farmland as well as removing sewage from the city. Very little change was seen from the decline of the Roman Empire until the 19th century, where improvements saw increasing efforts focused on public health in densely populated urban centers.</p>

                        <p class="subsection-text">Modern environmental engineering began in London in the mid-19th century when Joseph Bazalgette designed the first major sewerage system following the Great Stink. The city's sewer system conveyed raw sewage to the River Thames, which also supplied the majority of the city's drinking water, leading to an outbreak of cholera. The introduction of drinking water treatment and sewage treatment in industrialized countries reduced waterborne diseases from leading causes of death to rarities.</p>

                        <p class="subsection-text">The field emerged as a separate academic discipline during the middle of the 20th century in response to widespread public concern about water and air pollution and other environmental degradation on a national scale. As society and technology grew more complex, they increasingly produced unintended effects on the natural environment. One example is the widespread application of the pesticide DDT to control agricultural pests following World War II. The story of DDT as vividly told in Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" (1962) is considered to be the birth of the modern environmental movement, which led to the autonomous discipline of "environmental engineering."</p>
