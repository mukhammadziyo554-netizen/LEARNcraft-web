        <p class="intro-paragraph">
            Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation. Included broadly in the sciences, computer science spans theoretical disciplines such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory to applied disciplines including the design and implementation of hardware and software. The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.

                <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity. Wilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623. In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator and documented the binary number system.</p>
                    <p>Charles Babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine. In 1843, Ada Lovelace wrote an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer.</p>
                    <p>During the 1940s, with the development of new computing machines such as the Atanasoff-Berry computer and ENIAC, the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors. Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s. The world's first computer science degree program began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1953, and the first computer science department in the United States was formed at Purdue University in 1962.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Philosophy and Scope</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software. The discipline is often debated as to whether it is a science, mathematics, or engineering discipline. Some argue it is an empirical science since it makes use of empirical testing, while others classify it as an engineering discipline or mathematical discipline.</p>
                    <p>A famous quotation often attributed to Edsger Dijkstra states that "computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes." The design and deployment of computers is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science, such as computer engineering for hardware and information systems for commercial deployment.</p>
