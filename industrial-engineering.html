                        <p class="subsection-text">The origins of industrial engineering are generally traced back to the Industrial Revolution with the rise of factory systems and mass production. The fundamental concepts began to emerge through ideas like Adam Smith's division of labor and the implementation of interchangeable parts by Eli Whitney. The term "industrial engineer" is credited to James Gunn who proposed the need for such an engineer focused on production and cost analysis in 1901.</p>

                        <p class="subsection-text">Frederick Taylor (1856–1915) is generally credited as the father of the industrial engineering discipline. He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology and earned several patents from his inventions. Taylor is widely credited for his focus on scientific management, emphasizing time studies and standardized work methods, with his principles published in 1911. He established the first department dedicated to industrial engineering work, called "Elementary Rate Fixing," in 1885 with the goal of process improvement and productivity increase. Taylor is the author of many well-known works, including "The Principles of Scientific Management," which became a classic of management literature and is considered one of the most influential management books of the 20th century. The book laid out three goals: to illustrate how the country loses through inefficiency, to show that the solution to inefficiency is systematic management, and to show that the best management rests on defined laws, rules, and principles. Taylor is remembered for developing the stopwatch time study, which set the foundation for industrial engineering.</p>

                        <p class="subsection-text">Frank Gilbreth (1868–1924), along with his wife Lillian Gilbreth (1878–1972), also had a significant influence on the development of Industrial Engineering. Their work is housed at Purdue University. In 1907, Frank Gilbreth met Frederick Taylor and learned tremendously from Taylor's work. Frank and Lillian created 18 kinds of elemental motions that make up a set of fundamental motions required for a worker to perform a manual operation or task. They named the elements "therbligs," which are used in the study of motion in the workplace. These developments were the beginning of a much broader field known as human factors or ergonomics.</p>

                        <p class="subsection-text">Henry Gantt (1861–1919) immersed himself in the growing movement of Taylorism. Gantt is best known for creating a management tool, the Gantt chart. Gantt charts display dependencies pictorially, which allows project managers to keep everything organized. They are studied in colleges and used by project managers around the world. In addition to the creation of the Gantt chart, Gantt had many other significant contributions to scientific management. He cared about worker incentives and the impact businesses had on society. Today, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers awards a Gantt Medal for "distinguished achievement in management and for service to the community."</p>

This innovation reduced the time it took to build a car from more than 12 hours to one hour and 33 minutes. This continuous-flow inspired production method introduced a new way of automobile manufacturing. Ford is also known for transforming the workweek schedule. He cut the typical six-day workweek to five and doubled the daily pay, thus creating the typical 40-hour workweek.</p>

                        <p class="subsection-text">Through the efforts of Hugo Diemer, the first course on industrial engineering was offered as an elective at Pennsylvania State University in 1908. The first doctoral degree in industrial engineering was awarded in 1933 by Cornell University. The American Institute of Industrial Engineering was formed in 1948. The early work by F. W. Taylor and the Gilbreths was documented in papers presented to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers as interest grew from merely improving machine performance to the performance of the overall manufacturing process, most notably starting with the presentation by Henry R. Towne (1844–1924) of his paper "The Engineer as An Economist" (1886).</p>

                        <p class="subsection-text">From 1960 to 1975, with the development of decision support systems in supply such as material requirements planning (MRP), emphasis was placed on the timing issue (inventory, production, compounding, transportation, etc.) of industrial organization. Total quality management (TQM) emerged in the 1940s and gained momentum after World War II. Joseph Juran is credited with being a pioneer of TQM by teaching the concepts of controlling quality and managerial breakthrough. In the 1970s, with the penetration of Japanese management theories such as Kaizen and Kanban, Japan realized very high levels of quality and productivity. W. Edwards Deming made significant contributions in the minimization of variance starting in the 1950s. In the 1990s, following the global industry globalization process, the emphasis was on supply chain management and customer-oriented business process design. The theory of constraints, developed by Israeli scientist Eliyahu M. Goldratt (1985), is also a significant milestone in the field.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Systems Engineering History</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The origins of systems engineering as a recognized discipline can be traced back to World War II, where its principles began to emerge to manage the complexities of new war technologies. The analysis of the RAF Fighter Command C2 System during the Battle of Britain is considered an early example of high-caliber systems engineering. The first known public use of the term "systems engineering" occurred in March 1950 by Mervin J. Kelly of Bell Telephone Laboratories.</p>
                    <p>The first published paper specifically on the subject appeared in 1956 by Kenneth Schlager, who noted the growing importance of systems engineering due to increasing technological complexity. In 1957, E.W. Engstrom elaborated on the concept, emphasizing the determination of objectives and thorough consideration of influencing factors. That same year saw the publication of the first textbook, "Systems Engineering: An Introduction to the Design of Large-Scale Systems" by Goode and Mahol.</p>
                    <p>Despite its informal nature, systems engineering played a vital role in major achievements like the 1969 Apollo moon landing. A significant step towards formalization occurred in July 1969 with the introduction of the first formal systems engineering process, Military Standard (MIL-STD)-499 by the U.S. Air Force. The National Council on Systems Engineering (NCOSE) was formed in the late 1980s, evolving into the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE), which contributed through publications like its journal "Systems Engineering" starting in 1994 and the "Systems Engineering Handbook" in 1997. In 2005, the International Standards Organization (ISO) published its first standard defining systems engineering application and management, further solidifying its standing as a formal discipline.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>While originally applied to manufacturing, the use of "industrial" in industrial engineering can be somewhat misleading, since it has grown to encompass any methodical or quantitative approach to optimizing how a process, system, or organization operates. In fact, the "industrial" in industrial engineering means the industry in its broadest sense. People have changed the term industrial to broader terms such as industrial and manufacturing engineering, industrial and systems engineering, industrial engineering and operations research, or industrial engineering and management.</p>
