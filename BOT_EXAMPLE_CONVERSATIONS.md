## 🎯 Example 1: Getting a Daily Tip

```
User: /daily

Bot: 📚 *Daily Engineering Tip*

**Stress**: Stress is the internal force per unit area that a material experiences 
when subjected to external loads. Understanding stress is crucial in engineering 
design as it helps determine if materials will fail under given conditions.

💡 Tip: Use σ = F/A to calculate normal stress where F is force and A is 
cross-sectional area!

## 🧮 Example 3: Taking a Quiz

```
User: /quiz

Bot: 📊 *Engineering Quiz*

**Question**: A steel beam with cross-sectional area 100 mm² experiences 
a tensile force of 50 kN. What is the normal stress in MPa?

A) 500 MPa
B) 50 MPa
C) 5 MPa
D) 5000 MPa

User: Clicks "📖 View Answer"

Bot: ✅ *Quiz Answer*

**Answer**: A) 500 MPa

**Explanation**: 
- Stress = Force / Area
- σ = 50,000 N / 100 mm² = 500 N/mm² = 500 MPa
- Remember: 1 N/mm² = 1 MPa

This tests your understanding of stress calculations!

User: Clicks "🧮 Stress Problem"

Bot: 🧮 *Stress Problem*

*Problem:*
A concrete column (1m x 1m cross-section) supports a load of 500 kN. 
Calculate the compressive stress.

*Solution:*
- Cross-sectional area A = 1m × 1m = 1 m² = 1,000,000 mm²
- Force F = 500 kN = 500,000 N
- Stress σ = F/A = 500,000 N / 1,000,000 mm² = 0.5 N/mm² = 0.5 MPa
- This is well within safe limits for concrete!

This is a typical civil engineering problem!

## 🎓 Example 6: Interview Preparation

```
User: /interview

Bot: 💡 *Interview Tip*

**How to Explain Technical Concepts:**

During interviews, engineering managers want to hear that you can 
explain complex ideas clearly:

1️⃣ Start simple - Define the core concept in layman's terms
2️⃣ Add complexity - Gradually introduce technical details
3️⃣ Use examples - Provide real-world applications
4️⃣ Verify understanding - Ask if they want more depth

Example:
"Stress is the internal force per unit area in materials. 
Think of it like pressure - how hard the material is being pushed. 
We calculate it as Force divided by Area (σ = F/A)..."

## 📝 Example 7: Study Tips

```
User: /study

Bot: 📚 *Study Technique*

**Feynman Technique** - Learn Like an Expert

This technique forces you to understand concepts deeply:

1️⃣ Pick a concept (e.g., "stress")
2️⃣ Explain it simply - As if teaching a 10-year-old
3️⃣ Identify gaps - Where you struggled to explain
4️⃣ Refine - Simplify or reorganize your explanation
5️⃣ Review - Check accuracy with textbooks

💡 Why it works:
- Forces active learning (not passive reading)
- Reveals knowledge gaps immediately
- Creates better long-term retention
- Builds true understanding vs memorization

User: Clicks "🌉 Stress"

Bot: 🌍 *Stress Applications*

Stress is everywhere in engineering! Here's where:

🌉 **Bridges**: 
- Steel suspension cables experience tensile stress
- Concrete supports experience compressive stress
- Engineers calculate stress to ensure safety factor > 2.0

🏢 **Buildings**:
- Columns support compressive stress from floors above
- Walls experience shear stress from wind loads
- Moment connections transfer bending stress

✈️ **Aircraft**:
- Wings experience bending stress from lift forces
- Fuselage experiences tensile stress from pressurization
- Landing gear experiences impact and compressive stress

The same formulas you learn in class design these structures!
