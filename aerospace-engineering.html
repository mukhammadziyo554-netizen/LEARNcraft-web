        </div>

        <p class="intro-paragraph">
            Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the development of aircraft and spacecraft. It has two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Avionics engineering is similar but deals with the electronics side of aerospace engineering. Flight vehicles are subjected to demanding conditions such as those caused by changes in atmospheric pressure and temperature, with structural loads applied upon vehicle components.

                <h2 class="section-title">Overview and Disciplines</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Aerospace engineering is the product of various technological and engineering disciplines including aerodynamics, air propulsion, avionics, materials science, structural analysis and manufacturing. The interaction between these technologies is known as aerospace engineering. Because of the complexity and number of disciplines involved, aerospace engineering is carried out by teams of engineers, each having their own specialized area of expertise.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The origin of aerospace engineering can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Sir George Cayley, dating from the last decade of the 18th to the mid-19th century, is credited as the first person to separate the forces of lift and drag, which affect any atmospheric flight vehicle and is recognized as one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics.</p>
                    <p>Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical, with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering. Some key elements, like fluid dynamics, were understood by 18th-century scientists. In December 1903, the Wright Brothers performed the first sustained, controlled flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft, lasting 12 seconds. The 1910s saw the development of aeronautical engineering through the design of World War I military aircraft.</p>
                    <p>In 1914, Robert Goddard was granted two U.S. patents for rockets using solid fuel, liquid fuel, multiple propellant charges, and multi-stage designs, setting the stage for future applications in multi-stage propulsion systems for outer space. On March 3, 1915, the U.S. Congress established the first aeronautical research administration, known as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the first government-sponsored organization to support aviation research.</p>
                    <p>Between World Wars I and II, great leaps were made in the field, accelerated by the advent of mainstream civil aviation. A significant development came with the first operational jet engine-powered airplane, the Messerschmitt Me 262, which entered service in 1944 towards the end of the Second World War. The first definition of aerospace engineering appeared in February 1958, considering the Earth's atmosphere and outer space as a single realm.</p>
                    <p>In response to the USSR launching Sputnik, U.S. aerospace engineers launched the first American satellite on January 31, 1958. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration was founded in 1958 after the Sputnik crisis. In 1969, Apollo 11, the first human space mission to land on the Moon, took place with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin visiting the lunar surface.</p>
                    <p>On January 30, 1970, the Boeing 747 made its first commercial flight from New York to London, becoming known as the "Jumbo Jet" or "Queen of the Skies" due to its ability to hold up to 480 passengers. In 1976, the first passenger supersonic aircraft, the Concorde, was developed. On December 21, 1988, the Antonov An-225 Mriya cargo aircraft commenced its first flight, holding records for the world's heaviest aircraft. On October 25, 2007, the Airbus A380 made its maiden commercial flight, becoming the first passenger plane to surpass the Boeing 747 in passenger capacity with a maximum of 853.</p>

                    <p>The basis of most aerospace elements lies in theoretical physics, such as fluid dynamics for aerodynamics or the equations of motion for flight dynamics. There is also a large empirical component. Historically, this empirical component was derived from testing of scale models and prototypes, either in wind tunnels or in the free atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>More recently, advances in computing have enabled the use of computational fluid dynamics to simulate the behavior of the fluid, reducing time and expense spent on wind-tunnel testing. Those studying hydrodynamics or hydroacoustics often obtain degrees in aerospace engineering.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, aerospace engineering addresses the integration of all components that constitute an aerospace vehicle (subsystems including power, aerospace bearings, communications, thermal control, life support system, etc.) and its life cycle (design, temperature, pressure, radiation, velocity, lifetime).</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Education and Career</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Aerospace engineering may be studied at the advanced diploma, bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. levels in aerospace engineering departments at many universities, and in mechanical engineering departments at others. A few departments offer degrees in space-focused astronautical engineering. Some institutions differentiate between aeronautical and astronautical engineering. Graduate degrees are offered in advanced or specialty areas for the aerospace industry.</p>
                    <p>A background in chemistry, physics, computer science and mathematics is important for students pursuing an aerospace engineering degree. The term "rocket scientist" is sometimes used to describe a person of great intelligence since rocket science is seen as requiring great mental ability, especially technically and mathematically.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The term "rocket scientist" is sometimes used ironically in the expression "It's not rocket science" to indicate that a task is simple. Strictly speaking, the use of "science" in "rocket science" is a misnomer since science is about understanding the origins, nature, and behavior of the universe; engineering is about using scientific and engineering principles to solve problems and develop new technology. The more etymologically correct version would be "rocket engineer." However, "science" and "engineering" are often misused as synonyms in popular usage.</p>
