                    <p>Biomedical engineering has recently emerged as its own field, as compared to many other engineering fields. Such an evolution is common as a new field transitions from being an interdisciplinary specialization among already-established fields to being considered a field in itself. Biomedical engineers manage current medical equipment in hospitals while adhering to relevant industry standards. This involves procurement, routine testing, preventive maintenance, and making equipment recommendations, a role also known as a Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET) or clinical engineer.</p>
                    <p>Much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of research and development, spanning a broad array of subfields. Prominent biomedical engineering applications include the development of biocompatible prostheses, various diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants, imaging technologies such as MRI and EKG/ECG, regenerative tissue growth, and the development of pharmaceutical drugs including biopharmaceuticals.</p>

The greatest hurdles tend to be 510K "clearance" (typically for Class 2 devices) or premarket "approval" (typically for drugs and class 3 devices). Main regulatory objectives include ensuring products are safe, effective, and applicable to all manufactured devices. A product is safe if patients and users do not run unacceptable risks in intended use. A product is effective if it performs as specified by the manufacturer. These features must be ensured for all manufactured items through quality systems.</p>

                        <p class="subsection-text">In the U.S., an increasing number of undergraduate programs are recognized by ABET as accredited bioengineering/biomedical engineering programs. As of 2023, 155 programs are currently accredited by ABET. Many students use a B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering which includes biological science content as a "pre-med" major in preparation for medical school. In Canada and Australia, accredited graduate and undergraduate programs are common, with universities like McMaster University offering M.A.Sc, MD/PhD, and PhD degrees, and the University of Guelph offering the first Canadian undergraduate BME program as a four-year B.Eng.</p>

                        <p class="subsection-text">Graduate education is a particularly important aspect in BME. While many engineering fields do not need graduate-level training for entry-level positions, the majority of BME positions prefer or require graduate degrees. Since most BME professions involve scientific research in pharmaceutical and medical device development, graduate education is almost a requirement. Some undergraduate BME programs actively discourage students from majoring without expressing intention to obtain a master's degree or apply to medical school. Graduate programs in BME are highly varied and may emphasize certain aspects, featuring extensive collaboration with medical schools or other engineering divisions due to BME's interdisciplinary nature.</p>

                        <p class="subsection-text">Each state has certain requirements for becoming licensed as a registered Professional Engineer (PE). In the US, the Fundamentals of Engineering exam now covers biology. For the Professional Engineering exam, candidates may select a particular engineering discipline, though there is currently not a BME option, meaning biomedical engineers must prepare in another category. The Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) is exploring implementing a BME-specific version. Beyond governmental registration, private-sector organizations offer certifications such as the Certified Clinical Engineer (CCE) certification for clinical engineers. In the UK, mechanical engineers in Medical Engineering areas can gain Chartered Engineer status through the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.</p>

                    <p>In 2012 there were about 19,400 biomedical engineers employed in the US, and the field was predicted to grow by 5% (faster than average) from 2012 to 2022. Biomedical engineering has the highest percentage of female engineers compared to other common engineering professions. As of 2023, there are 19,700 jobs for this degree, with average pay around $100,730 and approximately $48.43 per hour. There is expected to be a 7% increase in jobs from 2023 to 2033 (even faster than the previous average). The number of biomedical engineers is expected to rise as both a cause and effect of improvements in medical technology.</p>
