        <p class="intro-paragraph">
            Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines and mechanisms that may involve force and movement. It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Mechanical engineering requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, design, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, motor vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The application of mechanical engineering can be seen in the archives of various ancient and medieval societies. The six classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East. Mesopotamian civilization is credited with the invention of the wheel, and the lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East.</p>
                    <p>Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century. In the 17th century, important breakthroughs in the foundations of mechanical engineering occurred in England and the Continent. During the early 19th century Industrial Revolution, machine tools were developed in England, Germany, and Scotland. This allowed mechanical engineering to develop as a separate field within engineering.</p>
                    <p>The first British professional society of mechanical engineers was formed in 1847 Institution of Mechanical Engineers. In the United States, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) was formed in 1880.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Degrees in mechanical engineering are offered at various universities worldwide. Mechanical engineering programs typically take four to five years of study and result in a Bachelor of Engineering degree. In the United States, most undergraduate mechanical engineering programs are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) to ensure similar course requirements and standards among universities.</p>
                    <p>The fundamental subjects required for mechanical engineering usually include mathematics, basic physical sciences, statics and dynamics, strength of materials, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, mechanism and machine design, manufacturing engineering, and computer-aided design (CAD).</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Mechanical engineers research, design, develop, build, and test mechanical and thermal devices, including tools, engines, and machines. They design and oversee the manufacturing of many products ranging from medical devices to new batteries. They also design power-producing machines such as electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and gas turbines.</p>
                    <p>Engineers may seek license by a state, provincial, or national government. In the U.S., to become a licensed Professional Engineer (PE), an engineer must pass the comprehensive FE (Fundamentals of Engineering) exam, work a minimum of 4 years as an Engineering Intern, and pass the PE (Professional Engineer) exams.</p>
